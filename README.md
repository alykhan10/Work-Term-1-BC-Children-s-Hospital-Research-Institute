# Baseline To Peak (BTP) Correction
● Performed an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test for 3 task-based frameworks from the Sanford PhD Dissertation [2019]         
● Graphed the Hemodynamic Response (HDR) of the BOLD MRI signal for the predictor weights and scan timepoints in Excel        
● Compiled the event-timebin variables for each component into an SPSS file and summarized validated findings into a report

# Principal Component (PCA) Analysis
● Conducted multivariable linear regression analysis on the standardized (Z) matrix for the Lavigne et al. Publication [2016]        
● Plotted eigenvalues following concatenation of overall (Z), predicted (Z') and residual matrices (E) to 105 from 1020 counts            
● Applied CT varimax rotation in MATLAB to optimize variance of the computed component scores and predictor loadings
